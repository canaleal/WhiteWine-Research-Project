##### Generating predictions of Wine Alcohol content using Pycaret and Regression Models. 

ABV (Alcohol by volume) is an important global standard of measurement that is used to quantify the alcohol content in wine. The determination of alcohol in wines is of great interest for consumers who drink and for producers who make them. For research purposes this paper will explore and visualise the differences of the alcohol content in white wine and afterwards, apply several machine learning algorithms to calculate the alcohol level. These methods are implemented on a sample dataset obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, created by Paulo Cortez from the Department of Information Systems, School of Engineering, University of Minho, Portugal. The dataset contains both red and white wine that originated in the historic Minho province in the far north of the country. For the purposes of this paper and to simplify the models, only white wine was used in the analysis. Results show that all of the employed machine learning methods have excellent RMSE, MAE, MSE, and R2 values. However, Light Gradient Boosting (RMSE = 0.2831), Extra Trees (RMSE = 0.3188), and Random Forest regressor (RMSE = 0.3186) provide additional information by generating the weight of each criterion and having better evaluation scores.
